## **VPC**
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

### CREATE VPC

##### Method 1: Via AWS Console

##### Method 2: Via AWS CLI (e.g. from your laptop)
